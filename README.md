# Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.
## Data Description
The dataset weâ€™ve consisted of records of Heart Disease. It  has various columns which describe the factors related with the heart disease such as the age, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP,  Cholesterol, Max HR, Exercise Angina etc. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 12 variables as explanatory variables:
- Age: age of the patient [years]
- Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
- Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
- FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
- MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
- ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
- ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
- HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
